# Step1 Functional Specification.

## Overview

Activity Monitor for .NET is an application that displays the usage rate of computer CPU, memory, etc. in numerical values and graphs.

This specification is updated at creation time and is always imperfect.

This application tracks the process of reorganizing the Windows Froms technology I was using and updating it as .NET technology evolves, but omits overly twisted or overly twisted ones.

Also note that the implementation lacks technical skills and is under-considered.
